# Acknowledgements
* Yuichi Sayama gave me an idea of how to make my task queue example simple and stable.
* Yusuke Tokuyoshi sent me the link to the paper ["Massively Parallel Construction of Radix Tree Forests for the Efficient Sampling of Discrete Probability Distributions"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05423.pdf).
